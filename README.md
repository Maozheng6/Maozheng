### Expertise
My PhD research focuses on multi-modal human-computer
interaction, specifically on combining modalities such as touch, voice,
and eye gaze with AI for a more natural and efficient interaction
experience on mobile devices. Apart from expertise in HCI, I also have
extensive experience with computer vision and LLMs from my previous
publications and internships.
