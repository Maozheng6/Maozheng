## Expertise
My PhD research focuses on multi-modal human-computer
interaction, specifically on combining modalities such as touch, voice,
and eye gaze with AI for a more natural and efficient interaction
experience on mobile devices. Apart from expertise in HCI, I also have
extensive experience with computer vision and LLMs from my previous
publications and internships.

## Education

**Ph.D., Stony Brook University, USA**<br/>
Major: Computer Science.  Advisor: Prof. Xiaojun Bi.  GPA: 3.78 <br/>
**Graduation date: December 2023.**<br/>
Aug, 2016-present.<br/>

**M.S., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing**<br/>
Major: Information and Communication Engineering.  GPA: 3.80<br/>
Sep, 2013 - Mar, 2016<br/>

**B.S., Harbin Engineering University**<br/>

## Internship experience

**Student researcher, Google, Mountain View, CA**<br/>
Dec, 2022 - May, 2023<br/>
Enabled Android settings search to understand natural language queries by LLMs. Created a dataset with pairs of natural language queries and answers by prompt engineering using LLMs, fine-tuned the LaMDA LLM with the dataset, evaluated the fine-tuned model with real user queries collected from a user study. The fine-tuned model significantly outperforms traditional search algorithms such as TF-IDF, and sentence encoding.

**Research Intern, Google, Mountain View, CA**<br/>
Oct, 2022 - Dec, 2022<br/>
(Same as the Google student researcher project above)<br/>

**Research Scientist Intern, Meta, Redmond, WA**<br/>
Reduced users' physical burden in gesture typing in virtual reality by utilizing eye tracking information. Published a conference paper in IUI 2024 from the intern project.<br/>
